```


## 🔐 Firebase Setup (IMPORTANT for Buyers)

This project **does NOT include** `google-services.json` or `GoogleService-Info.plist` because these files contain private keys.

Each buyer must add their own Firebase configuration.

### 📍 Step 1: Create a Firebase Project

Visit: [https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)
Create a new project and add your Android, iOS, and Web apps.


### 📍 Step 2: Download the Required Files

#### **Android**

Download:

```
google-services.json
```

Place it here:

```
android/app/google-services.json
```

#### **iOS**

Download:

```
GoogleService-Info.plist
```

Place it here:

```
ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist
```

#### **Web**

Copy the Firebase JS Config and place it inside:

```
web/firebase-config.js   (or your environment file)
```


### 📍 Step 3: Enable Required Firebase Services

Depending on your setup:

* Authentication
* Cloud Firestore / Realtime DB
* FCM (Push Notifications)
* Storage (Images, uploads)


## ⚙️ Customization & Integration

* Modify UI components in `lib/` for easy re-branding.
* Connect to any backend (Laravel API, Node.js, Django, etc.).
* Add language translations via Flutter localization.
* Extend functionality (wishlist, notifications, payments, profile system, etc.).
